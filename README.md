# Project Name

This weeks project was to creat our own version of the board game Guess Who? using HTML, CSS and Javascript.


## The problem

I started to go trough all the material about, for example, object, arrays and loops. Then I started right away to manage to do as much as possible in the beginning of the week to have time left if I was needing help. I solved the first stepd by my self and then I asked my team for help. If I had more time I would have changed the desig more than the background color and also changed the persons and attributes to something else.
